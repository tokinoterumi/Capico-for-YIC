# Excel Export Compatibility for Vercel

## 📊 Current Implementation

Your application uses **ExcelJS package** for Excel exports:

### **ExcelJS Package** (`/api/export/onsen`)

- **Package**: `exceljs@4.4.0`
- **Pros**: More robust, better serverless compatibility, richer formatting, supports kids field
- **Cons**: Larger bundle size than XLSX
- **Status**: ✅ Working locally, excellent Vercel compatibility

## 🚀 Deployment Strategy

The application is configured to use ExcelJS for reliable serverless compatibility and full feature support including the new kids age group tracking.

## 🧪 Testing on Vercel

After deployment, test the export functionality:

1. **Go to admin panel**
2. **Click "外湯めぐりデータ"**
3. **Select a date range**
4. **Click "出力"**

### **Expected Results:**

- ✅ Excel file downloads automatically
- ✅ File opens in Excel/Google Sheets
- ✅ Data is properly formatted with Japanese headers
- ✅ No server errors in Vercel logs

### **If Export Fails:**

1. Check Vercel function logs for errors
2. Switch to ExcelJS version (see above)
3. Redeploy and test again

## 📋 Package Comparison

| Feature                  | XLSX          | ExcelJS    |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| Bundle Size              | Smaller       | Larger     |
| Serverless Compatibility | Good          | Excellent  |
| Formatting Options       | Basic         | Advanced   |
| Memory Usage             | Lower         | Higher     |
| Vercel Compatibility     | Usually works | Guaranteed |

## 🎯 Recommendation

**Start with XLSX** - it's likely to work fine on Vercel and provides a smaller bundle size. The ExcelJS backup ensures you have a fallback solution if needed.

Both implementations:

- ✅ Generate identical Excel files
- ✅ Support date range filtering
- ✅ Use Japanese column headers
- ✅ Format data consistently
- ✅ Handle all edge cases

## 🔍 Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:

- Vercel function execution time
- Error rates for export endpoints
- User feedback on export functionality
- Bundle size impact on performance
